This bundle contains all scripts required to reproduce the IPC Autoscale
benchmarks as described in the ICAPS 2021 paper "Automatic Instance
Generation for Classical Planning" by √Ålvaro Torralba, Jendrik Seipp and
Silvan Sievers.

* Directory "optimization" contains the main bulk of the experiment
  scripts for all phases of the instance generation approach described in
  the paper. See usage instructions below.

* Directory "pddl-generators" contains all generators of IPC domains that
  were used for this paper (and some additional ones).

* Directory "planners" contains source code as well as Singularity recipe
  files for all planners used in the paper. It also contains two scripts
  for building all the corresponding Singularity images.

* Directory "logfiles" contains the logs of the benchmark-optimization.py
  script for the results of the paper.

* Directory "report" contains some additional scripts and Jupyter
  notebooks used to manually inspect the results of preliminary
  experiments. They can show some interesting additional data, but they
  are not intended to be maintained.


# Requirements
 - Singularity
 - SMAC
 - CPLEX

TODO: Provide details here? Link? Installation instructions?


# Usage
Before running the optimization, the following steps need to be conducted:
* Edit domain_configuration.py to add the description of any new domain that you want to configure.

* Edit planner_selection.py to add the state-of-the-art planners that are relevant for
  each domain. The script select-best-planner-per-domain.py can help to automatically
  select a set of planners per domain from the results of earlier experiments.

Then, the following two steps must be performed:
1. Run linear.py to perform the SMAC optimization and generate sequences.
     TODO: Perhaps point out to one of Jendrik's script on how to do this.

2. Gather all results from one or multiple SMAC runs (do we still have to do this step?) into a single properties json file.
     TODO:  Perhaps point out to one of Jendrik's script on how to do this.

3. Run benchmark-optimization.py to generate benchmark set. The --database is used to provide the properties file obtained from step 2.
     generate-benchmarks-2020-12-10.sh contains an example on how this script was




# Experiments data

The optimization/results folder contains json files with the results of the experiments.
The results table in the paper is generated via the scripts report-gather-dataset.py and
report-create-table.py
