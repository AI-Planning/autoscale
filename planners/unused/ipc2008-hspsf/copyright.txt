The source code in this archive is released without copyright (i.e., it
is public domain). You may use it in any way for any purpose (including
to make a profit - ha!). Note, however, that you can not copyright it
(precisely because it has been made _public_ without copyright). You can
still copyright works derived from it, though it seems most judicial
systems apply some measure of common sense in interpreting what is a
"derived work" (in short, you have to put some actual _work_ into making
it).
