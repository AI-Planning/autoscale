Note: If you're using the FD-lab scripts to run experiments, there are
a couple of things that have to be changed (in case that you run the
planner calling the plan script that we provide you can ignore all
this). We made change on the translator and preprocessor so you cannot
re-use the preprocessed files from another planners. Also, the
preprocessor needs to receive "--opt-ordering" as parameter. Our plan
script already does that, but using FD-lab will skip that part so a
workaround is needed (e.g, modify the code of preprocess to put
opt-ordering to true as default).


Note: This version is built based on SymBA*-2 as published by Torralba on
his website https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/torralba/software.html

Differences added by us:
- polishing (output, braces or similiar)
- a bugfix from a recent version of the h2-preprocessor
- add a test that checks if the empty plan is a valid solution
- add a test that checks if, after computing h2 mutexes, there are no necessary
variables left, and thus the problem is unsolvable (inspired from a recent
version of the h2-preprocessor, which is too different to completely adapting
the test)
- a bugfix that changes long to double (and to bool in the case of a simple
true-or-false method), as communicated by √Ålvaro in the context of the IPC on
