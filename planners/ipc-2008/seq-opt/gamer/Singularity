Bootstrap: docker
From: i386/ubuntu:18.04

%setup
    ## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
    ## container. It copies the source files from the branch of your
    ## repository where this file is located into the container to the
    ## directory "/planner". Do not change this part unless you know
    ## what you are doing and you are certain that you have to do so.

    REPO_ROOT=`dirname $SINGULARITY_BUILDDEF`
    cp -r $REPO_ROOT/ $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/planner

%post
    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.

    ## Install all dependencies.
    apt update
    apt install -y --no-install-recommends g++ make openjdk-8-jdk

    cd /planner

    ## Build the planner.
    ./build

    ## Clean up.
    apt -y autoremove g++ make
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

%runscript
    ## The runscript is called whenever the container is used to solve
    ## an instance.
