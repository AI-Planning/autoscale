Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:bionic

%setup
     ## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
     ## container. It copies the source files from the branch of your
     ## repository where this file is located into the container to the
     ## directory "/planner". Do not change this part unless you know
     ## what you are doing and you are certain that you have to do so.

    REPO_ROOT=`dirname $SINGULARITY_BUILDDEF`
    cp -r $REPO_ROOT/ $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/planner

%post

    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.

    ## Install all necessary dependencies.
    apt-get update
    apt-get -y install cmake g++ make python

    ## Build planner.
    cd /planner
    ./build.py release64

    ## Build h2-mutexes preprocessor.
    mkdir -p builds/h2-mutexes/
    cd builds/h2-mutexes/
    cmake ../../h2-mutexes/
    make -j4

    ## Clean up.
    apt -y autoremove cmake g++ make
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

%runscript
    ## The runscript is called whenever the container is used to solve
    ## an instance.

    PROBLEMFILE=$2

    ## Call your planner.
