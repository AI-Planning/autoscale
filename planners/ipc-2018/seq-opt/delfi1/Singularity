%setup
     ## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
     ## container. It copies the source files from the branch of your
     ## repository where this file is located into the container to the
     ## directory "/planner". Do not change this part unless you know
     ## what you are doing and you are certain that you have to do so.

    REPO_ROOT=`dirname $SINGULARITY_BUILDDEF`
    cp -r $REPO_ROOT/ $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/planner

%post

    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.

    ## Install all necessary dependencies.
    apt update
    apt -y install cmake gawk g++ g++-multilib make python python-dev python-pip
    #apt -y install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
    pip install h5py keras numpy pillow scipy tensorflow subprocess32
    #pip3 install h5py keras numpy pillow scipy tensorflow

    ## Build your planner
    cd /planner
    ./build.py release64 -j4
    cd /planner/symba
    ./build -j4

    ## Clean up
    mkdir -p /compiled-planner/builds/release64
    mv /planner/driver /compiled-planner
    mv /planner/symba /planner/symba.py /compiled-planner
    mv /planner/fast-downward.py /planner/plan-ipc.py /planner/create-image-from-graph.py /planner/timers.py /compiled-planner
    mv /planner/dl_model /compiled-planner

%runscript
    ## The runscript is called whenever the container is used to solve
    ## an instance.

Description This planner uses an offline learned algorithm selector to choose the "best" planner online based on a abstract structure graph of the PDDL description of the planning task. In particular, the learning algorithm uses such graphs of a planning task, turns them into an image and uses the planner runtime to train a neural net. The learned model thus predicts runtime of planners on a given task and chooses a planner accordingly.
