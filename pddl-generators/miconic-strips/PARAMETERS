OPTIONS   DESCRIPTIONS

-f <num>    number of floors (minimal 2)
-p <num>    number of passengers (minimal 1)



IPC instances: linear scaling where passengers go from 1 to 30. Number of floors is
passengers x 2.  5 random instances


We can follow a similar schema, where we do a linear scaling of the number of passengers
and keep floors at passengers x 2. We can also allow to add some parameter c that controls
the ratio between passengers and floors.
