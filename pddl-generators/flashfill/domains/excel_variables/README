3. EXCEL/FLASH-FILL
This domain is located in the domains/excel_variables/ folder.
We created 5 different problems under the same domain:
01. Add a right parenthesis at the end of the input string
e.g.: (BOB => (BOB)
02. Extract the minutes from a timer
e.g.: 8:23.65 => 23
03. The input is 2 strings Name and Surname, and the goal is to copy these strings in the output with the following format => Surname + space + Name
e.g.: Bob Doe => Doe Bob
04. The same input as 03 but the aim is to copy the strings in the output with the following format => Name + space + first letter of the surname
e.g.: Bob Doe => Bob D
05. Get Name and Surname and output the initials of both strings separated by a space
e.g. Bob Doe => B D





06 Get Name and Surname and output email address
