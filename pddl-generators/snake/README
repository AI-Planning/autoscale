In the game Snake, a snake moves around a grid. There is a number of apples in some grid
cells and when the snake moves into one of these locations, it eats the apple, extends its
length by one, and a new apple may spawn. In this version uncertainty has been removed by
deciding the location where apples will spawn in advance. Except for the end of the game,
there will be more than one apple on the board at the same time.

Interesting properties: dead-end states
