target-typed-01.pddl through target-typed-30.pddl: learning distribution (IPC 08)
thoughtful_*-typed.pddl: testing distribution learning distribution (IPC 08)

adapted to domain.pddl from IPC 14 (change predicate suit -> suittype)

* files from IPC 14, satisficing track:

bootstrap-typed-01.pddl - bootstrap-typed-06.pddl
p*-typed.pddl
leaving out target-typed-21.pddl through target-typed-28.pddl because they are the same as those from learning IPC 08
